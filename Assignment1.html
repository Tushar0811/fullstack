<h1><strong>Whatever you do, just don't sit still. Keep Growing Constantly</strong></h1>
<p>
    Do you ever feel subdued and defeated by time? Isn't the feeling more like being enslaved by every emotion you desire to avoid? Every aspiration of yours is brutally killed by the laziness you inevitably abide to. And despite knowing that the moments won't come back, you spend them carelessly, often preparing to regret in the future. This doesn't mean that you are not aware of the fact that you are distracted. You very well know your path and dreams, but you simply to choose to ignore them for later. And the more careless you become, the more guilt you build upon. Every sunrise reminds you of your chaotic life, and every time you turn to bed, your eyes feel heavy of the guilt.
    No, this doesn't mean that you should never spend any instance of your life being unproductive or unbalanced.
    Of course you can lie around and relax, but it shouldn't become a routine; for you are here to grow. You exist
    so that you can grow up to find yourself and your purpose. And instead of drowning yourself in the ocean of
    idleness and unproductivity, you should learn to spend time wisely enough to not regret. And you will know when
    you don't regret any single moment of your life, for the moment you lie down to sleep, you will smile. You will
    sleep without any regret or guilt. And that's when you will realise you are growing, you are changing, and the
    best part would be that you will change for the better. Every sunrise will be a new ray in your life and every
    ray will bring out a new colour in you. Your eyes will reflect happiness and your story will portray self-love.
    All of this isn't easy, but it isn't really tough too. You just require a bit of patience, passion and perception.
